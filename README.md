Problem Description
The input:
Given a set X and a collection S of subsets of X.
The goal...
Find a sub-collection S* of S that satisfies the two conditions:
  The intersection of any two distinct subsets in S* is empty (no overlapping) .
     The union of the subsets in S* is X. For example,
Let set X = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, and S ={A, B, C, D, E} be a collection ofsubsets:
  A={1, 5}
  B={1, 3, 4}
  C={3, 4}
  D={2, 4}
  E={3}
The sub-collection S* = {A, D, E} is exact covering solution for X.
